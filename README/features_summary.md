## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Camera Not Working
**Causes:**
- Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Browser permissions denied
- Older browser without camera support

**Solution:**

- Grant camera permission when prompted
- Try Chrome/Firefox
- Use manual barcode entry as fallback

### Email Not Sending
**Causes:**
- Gmail app password incorrect
- 2FA not enabled
- MAIL_USERNAME not set

**Solution:**
- Use App Password for Gmail (not regular password)
- Enable 2FA on Gmail first
- Check environment variables
- See EMAIL_SETUP.md

### Database Lost on Render
**Cause:** Free tier ephemeral storage

**Solutions:**
1. Regular backups (download from Admin)
2. Use PostgreSQL database (paid option)
3. Use persistent disk (paid option)

### Barcode Scanner Freezing
**Cause:** Camera permission issues

**Solution:**
- Refresh page
- Check browser permissions
- Try manual entry
- Use different device
