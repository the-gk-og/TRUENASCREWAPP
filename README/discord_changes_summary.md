ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN discord_username VARCHAR(100);

```

DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url

# Random secret for bot verification
DISCORD_BOT_SECRET=random_secret_string

# Your Discord server ID

```

## How It Works

### Event Creation Flow

1. **Admin creates event in web app**
   ```python
   POST /events/add
   ```

2. **Event saved to database**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO event (title, date, etc...)
   ```

3. **Discord message posted automatically**
   ```python
   send_discord_message(event)
   # Posts to webhook with embed and reactions
   ```

4. **Reminders scheduled**
   ```python
   schedule_discord_notifications(event)
   # Threads scheduled for 1 week before and day-of
   ```

### Crew Member Joins Flow

**Via Discord Reaction:**
```
1. Crew member clicks ‚úã reaction
2. Discord sends reaction event to bot
3. Bot calls /discord/join-event endpoint
4. Endpoint verifies Discord ID
5. Creates CrewAssignment in database
6. Marks as assigned_via='discord'
7. Returns success to Discord
```

**Via Web App:**
```
1. Crew member selected from dropdown
2. POST /crew/assign endpoint
3. CrewAssignment created (assigned_via='webapp')
4. Email notification sent (if configured)
5. Discord notification sent (if configured)
```

### Account Linking Flow

```
1. Crew member in Discord: /link-account
2. Discord modal appears
3. Enter Production Crew username
4. User logs in to web app
5. Go to Discord settings page
6. Complete linking process
7. Discord ID & username saved to User model
8. Now receives Discord notifications
```
